## ‚ú® Features

This initial version (v0.1a) provides a solid foundation for a powerful circuit drafting tool:

*   **Core Drawing Tools:**
    *   **Component Library:** Includes Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Diode, Voltage Source, Battery, and Ground symbols.
    *   **Smart Wiring:** Wires automatically snap to component terminals, the grid, or other wires.
    *   **Manhattan & Direct Routing:** Draw right-angled (Manhattan) wires by default, or hold `Shift` for straight-line (direct) connections.
    *   **Automatic Junctions:** Junction dots are automatically drawn where three or more wires/terminals connect.
    *   **Text Labels:** Add text annotations to your schematic. Supports the `Œ©` symbol via the `/ohm` shortcut.

*   **Editing & Workflow:**
    *   **Select & Move:** Easily select and reposition any element on the canvas.
    *   **Rotate:** Rotate selected components in 45-degree increments.
    *   **Duplicate:** Quickly copy and paste selected elements.
    *   **Delete:** Remove unwanted elements from the schematic.
    *   **Undo/Redo:** Full history support for undoing and redoing actions.

*   **Usability:**
    *   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Intuitive hotkeys for tools and actions to speed up your workflow.
    *   **Snapping Grid:** Elements and wire points snap to a grid for clean, aligned diagrams.
    *   **High-Resolution Export:** Export your entire circuit as a crisp PNG image with a user-defined resolution scale.

*   **Technology:**
    *   **100% Client-Side:** Runs entirely in your browser. No server or backend required.
    *   **Zero Dependencies:** Written in pure, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks or external libraries (besides Google Material Icons).

## üìù Future Development (To-Do)

This project is in its early stages. Here are some ideas for future versions:

-   [ ] **More Components:** Add transistors (BJT, MOSFET), op-amps, logic gates, etc.
-   [ ] **Component Properties:** A panel to edit component values (e.g., "10kŒ©", "100uF") and labels.
-   [ ] **Save/Load Project:** Implement saving the circuit state to a local `.json` file or browser `localStorage`.
-   [ ] **SVG Export:** Add an option to export diagrams as scalable vector graphics.
-   [ ] **Theming:** Introduce a dark mode for late-night drafting sessions.
-   [ ] **Improved Wire Editing:** Allow dragging and modification of existing wire segments.
